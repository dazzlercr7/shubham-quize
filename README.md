# Understanding GITHUB

This is just a Demo  README file created while learning GITHUB. This is like exercise where we learn about commit it is just like a checkpoint where only the changes made in the file are saved and not the whole file.And Git is a public source platform provided to publish and share your code to everyone in the world or even you can keep it private for some codes which you doesn't need to share with others. While it also act as a storage for your programs on cloud.
